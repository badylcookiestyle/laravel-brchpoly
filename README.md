<h1>Monopoly Anti-cheat</h1>
<h4>It's my first project in laravel. It's literally  monopoly anti-cheat. What do I mean by that? Everyone knows this feeling when you're playing monopoly with friends and somebody starts cheating it's really frustrating. So I prepared small application which allows you to create account and make boards. In those boards you can save every action which happens in the game, you can also rollback and edit them.There is also simple settings panel in this project I mean you can change your password or just delete your account. <span style="color:red">There is also a very usefull feature it's language switching</span></h4>
<h2>I'll show here the most important panels</h2>
